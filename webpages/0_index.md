<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should organize your data into logical units based on structure and theme.  EDI has recommendations for organizing data by theme. </span>

 	<li><strong>2. Format and QC data tables</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some data types may benefit from a specific format and by having specific types of checks run. You'll want to keep track of the QC steps you take so others will know what's been done to these data. </span>

<td>Data managers are generally comfortable with basic metadata concepts and writing code. There are numerous resources, including "best practice" guides, templates, and code libraries.</td>
<td>If you don't have access to coding or metadata expertise, contact EDI. We can provide you with a metadata template, and instructions for data table assembly, to get your dataset into our queue.</td>
