<h3>1. Assemble data and metadata </h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should organize your data into logical units based on structure and theme.  EDI has recommendations for organizing data by theme. </span>
<ul>

</ul>


<h3>2. Format and QC data tables</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some data types may benefit from a specific format and by having specific types of checks run. You'll want to keep track of the QC steps you take so others will know what's been done to these data. </span>

<h3>3. Create EML metadata</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Data Managers</th>
<th>Scientists</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data managers are generally comfortable with basic metadata concepts and writing code. There are numerous resources, including "best practice" guides, templates, and code libraries.</td>
<td>If you don't have access to coding or metadata expertise, contact EDI. We can provide you with a metadata template, and instructions for data table assembly, to get your dataset into our queue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Metadata resources for DIY EML creation [link here to EXISTING page]()</td>
<td>Metadata resources for scientists [link here to EXISTING page]()</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>4. Submit your data package (data and metadata)</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Data Managers</th>
<th>Scientists</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data managers generally have submitted data to a repository before</td>
<td>Scientists do not need to interact directly with the repository, but can work with EDI data managers (humans)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>instructions for EDI repository submission [link here to EXISTING page]()</td>
<td>instructions for sending data/metadata and other inquiries  [link here to EXISTING page]()</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>5. Cite it</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>You're done. You can retrieve your data citation, and/or its DOI, or to link the data package to your web page
