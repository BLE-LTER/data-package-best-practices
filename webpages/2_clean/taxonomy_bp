How-to: Taxonomy

1. EDI recommends resolving taxonomic information to trustworthy taxonomic information systems, i.e. using IDs from those taxonomic systems because:
	a) The IDs are stable even if the taxonomy names change
	b) Taxon systems usually provide a user interface for retrieving other taxon levels, old names, type specimen etc.
2. EDI recommends the following practices for use of Taxonomy: 
	a) Columns in your data tables:
		i)   Scientific name
		ii)  Serial number/ID provided as by the taxonomic authority you are using.
		iii) Categorical variable for the name of taxonomic information system, for example ITIS or WoRMS (or other).
		iv)  Explain acronyms such as "ITIS " in metadata.
	b) The lowest possible taxon level should be referenced.
	c) This practice should be applied to the most recent data and older ones if time allows.
3. The Taxon System should cover the taxonomy in your geographic area and be reliable. 
4. Examples of Taxonomy Systems
	a) World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)
	b) Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), for terrestrial ecosystems.
5. Potential conflicts and other issues:
	a) Reconciling multiple returns on a search
	b) Coalescing sp > genus and vice versa, 
	c) Decision on when you need expert review.
6. EDI provides the taxonomyCleanr R package to clean your taxonomy data.
