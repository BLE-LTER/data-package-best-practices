        - EDI personnel will generate EML from metadata that you provide to us, from the template, or we will teach you how to generate EML files yourself.   In either case, the process starts with describing your data set using the In this document, you will enter a title, an abstract, who is involved with collecting the data, where and when the study was done, and detailed information about each attribute (column) in your data file(s).
