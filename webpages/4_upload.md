<!-- page title: Step 2. Submit your data package -->
There are two methods for data submission: one in which one in which you create EML metadata yourself amd one in which EDI creates metadata for you. THe first pathway is faster, because you know your data best, there is less back-and-forth and the process is less asynchronous. This is the better choice for those who know a small bit of the R programming language, and can perform one or two trial uploads. Usually, data managers use this pathway, as do comutationally adept scientists. 

 Many scientists are not versed in metadata creation or in R. In these cases, EDI will help you. This pathway is a bit slower, because in addition to filling out the metadata form, you will have to answer questions from us to resolve issues, and approve a draft of the final data package.
