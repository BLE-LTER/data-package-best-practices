# Ongoing data

mostly you want to add new rows, not new columns (new cols is a 'redesign').


**Ongoing time-series observations** (instrumented or not): Remember that all data 
packages have static data entities, and so in the case of ongoing time-series, these are
"snapshots" at points in time.

- continuous: all observations are groupled into a single unit (table), with plans to add data by revising the same package and updating metadata. 
- non-continuous: a new packages is created for each logical unit (e.g., a summer sampling season), regardless of similarities or differences in methods.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.
