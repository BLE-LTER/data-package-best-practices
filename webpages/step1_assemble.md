*What kind of data have you got? (maybe organized as a flowchart - what to do with it)
- [Considerable amount of stuff from LTER can go here - mob
- Dataset design - (Type-specific recommendations)
- Small tables and static datasets (possibly related to publication)
- Ongoing time series
- Streaming data 
- - with the GCE Data Toolbox for Matlab
- Community survey data - BPs
- - Using the ecocomDP model - mob
- Spatial data
* Do you have access to data mgt expertise/help? Can you write R code?
