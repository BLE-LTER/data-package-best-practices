Rough (very) start on pages for how to work with portal


Re: manual uploads:
There must be a distribution elemen (otherwise it is invalid EML, and package is rejected).
 
Solution: put in a place holder URL (it can be a fake URL)
The checker looks for valid data URLs --  but if you choose to upload the entity manually, the checker will return 
valid no matter what you put in that URL (your URL is ignored). [more info than anyone wants: the data portal is 
supplying a URL to stage your data, and runs the check on that ]
