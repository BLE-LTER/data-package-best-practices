This page should probably be renamed - it should be the index page for section 4 - upload.

This is a rough (very) start on pages for how to work with portal


Re: manual uploads

Problem
- There must be a distribution element (otherwise EML is invalid and package is rejected).
 
Solution: put in a place holder URL (it can be a fake URL)
- The checker looks for valid data URLs --  but if you choose to upload the entity manually, the checker will return 
valid no matter what you put in that URL (your URL is ignored). [more info than anyone wants: the data portal is 
supplying a URL to stage your data, and runs the check on that ]
