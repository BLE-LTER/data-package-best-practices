## Introduction
The “quality” of a data package is a reflection of how well it may be used for a specific purpose. The EDI Repository (URL HERE) ingests EML-described datasets for presentation and use for synthesis and workflows. To be useful, data package must include access to data, adequate metadata plus strong agreement between the metadata and data (i.e., congruence). 

The ECC was developed originally by the LTER Network Information Managers Committee (IMC) and adopted by EDI along with other software components (e.g., PASTA). The original working group was formed at the LTER All Scientists Meeting in 2009 at Estes Park
  -  Committee Members: LTER: Margaret O'Brien (chair), Corinna Gries, Emery Boose, Dan Bahauddin, Gastil Gastil-Buhl, Jason Downing, Sven Bohm, James Brunt, Mark Servilla (software desigher/developer), Duane Costa (principal developer). 
  -  Associates: Matt Jones, Mark Shildhauer, Ben Leinfleder, Jing Tao (NCEAS Ecoinformatics programming group).
## What it does
the EML Congruence Checker reports on aspects of data packages submitted to ensure they meet a standard of high quality. As of 2018, 40 checks have been implemented. The report results become part of the data package in the repository. A small number will prevent the dataset being added to the repository; these were carefully chosen to reflect only conditions that will make a dataset unusable under any circumstances.
