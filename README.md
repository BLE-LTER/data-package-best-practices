# data-package-best-practices

This repository was initiated in late 2019, after EML 2.2 release.  It holds best practices recommendations related to data packages, written by the community of data managers who contributed to the EDI repository. The public-facing view is organized as gh-pages, which are copied over from draft area *when ready* (ie, edits to pages do not automatically become public). 

There are several axes of organization anticipated, below, with examples.

- Metadata concepts (apply to most or all scientific domains)
  - creators
  - keywords
  - geoCoverage 
  - taxonCoverage
  - temporalCoverage
  - annotation
  - project
  - methods
  - data entities
  - citations of papers (in a data package)
  
- Scientific domain
  - community survey data
  - meteorology/hydrology data
  - genomics and metagenomics
  
- Acquisition method or organizing practice (often apply to multiple scientific domains) 
  - offline data
  - key-value pair tables (long vs. wide)
  - model output
  - drone-collected
  - photo imagery
  - acoustics



## What this repository does not contain
This git repository/website is not intended to be your only resource for data management. This repository's focus is "data packages", and of course other aspects of data and information management overlap with that. Many other tools exist, and have their own repositories and help-pages. See EDI's [5 phases of data publication](https://github.com/EDIorg/five_phases_DM) for informatation and links to resources related to:
- how to interact with the EDI repository and portal (PASTA)
- how to interpret congruence checker messages (ECC)
- broader topics, e.g., 
  - handling bibliographic resouces
  - finding and using all-in-one solutions such as DEIMS, GCE-toolbox
  - back-end databases such as LTER-metabase


## Background:
- The first "BPs" (and the origins of this collection) were focused on the use of the EML metadata schema, and created by the LTER data managers [version 1 EML BP, 2005](link here, in archive dir). 
- Over time, that document was expanded to include specifics about data types and practices of the LTER related to the then-nascent PASTA system [version 2 EML BP, 2012?](link here, in archive dir).  
- As these recommendations for practice continue to grow, [EDI](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org) (established in 2016) 
  - revised the EML BP to general material about use of the EML spec [version 3 EML BP, 2017](link here, in archive dir)
  - created this repository to house that and other data package recommendations as gh-pages.
