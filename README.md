# data-package-best-practices

Initiated in 2019, after EML 2.2 release. 

This repo holds BPs related to data packages. It is organized as gh-pages. 

There are several axes of organization anticipated, based on:

- metadata concepts derived from EML metadata, e.g.:
  - creators
  - keywords
  - geoCoverage 
  - taxonCoverage
  - temporalCoverage
  - annotation
  - project
  - methods
  - data entities
  - citations of papers (in a data package)
  
- content types:
  - community survey data
  - meteorology/hydrology data
  
- organizing principles:
  - offline data
  - key-value pair tables (long vs. wide)



## Background:
- The first "BPs" related to the collection in this repository were focused on the use of the EML metadata schema, and created by the LTER data managers [link here, in archive dir])(version 1 EML BP, 2005). 
- Over time, that document was expanded to include specifics about data types and LTER practices related to the then-nascent PASTA system ([link here, in archive dir](version 2 EML BP, 2012?).  
- As these recommendations for practice continue to grow, [link here] (EDI) (established in 2016) 
  - revised the EML BP to general material about use of the EML spec [link here, in archive dir])(version 3 EML BP, 2017)
  - created this repository to house that and other data package recommendations as gh-pages.
  
  
## what this repository does not contain
This git repository/website is not intended to be your ownly resource for data management. And of course other aspects of data and information management overlap with the main topic here: data packages. Many other tools exist, and have their own repositories and help-pages. See EDI's [link here](5 phases of data publication) for informatation an links to resources related to:
- how to interact with the EDI repository and portal
- other aspects of data mgt, e.g., 
  - handling of bibliographic resouces
  - use of all-in-one solutions such as DEIMS, GCE-toolbox
  - back-end databases such as LTER-metabase
