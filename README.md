# data-package-best-practices

This repository was initiated in late 2019, after EML 2.2 release.  It holds best practices recommendations related to data packages, written by the community of data managers who contributed to the EDI repository. It is organized as gh-pages. 

There are several axes of organization anticipated, based on:

- metadata concepts derived from EML metadata, e.g.:
  - creators
  - keywords
  - geoCoverage 
  - taxonCoverage
  - temporalCoverage
  - annotation
  - project
  - methods
  - data entities
  - citations of papers (in a data package)
  
- content types:
  - community survey data
  - meteorology/hydrology data
  
- organizing principles:
  - offline data
  - key-value pair tables (long vs. wide)



## Background:
- The first "BPs" related to the collection in this repository were focused on the use of the EML metadata schema, and created by the LTER data managers [version 1 EML BP, 2005](link here, in archive dir). 
- Over time, that document was expanded to include specifics about data types and LTER practices related to the then-nascent PASTA system [version 2 EML BP, 2012?](link here, in archive dir).  
- As these recommendations for practice continue to grow, [EDI](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org) (established in 2016) 
  - revised the EML BP to general material about use of the EML spec [version 3 EML BP, 2017](link here, in archive dir)
  - created this repository to house that and other data package recommendations as gh-pages.
  
  
## what this repository does not contain
This git repository/website is not intended to be your only resource for data management. This repository's focus is "data packages", and of course other aspects of data and information management overlap with that. Many other tools exist, and have their own repositories and help-pages. See EDI's [5 phases of data publication](https://github.com/EDIorg/five_phases_DM) for informatation an links to resources related to:
- how to interact with the EDI repository and portal (PASTA)
- how to interpret congruence checker (ECC)
- other aspects of data mgt, e.g., 
  - handling bibliographic resouces
  - finding and using of all-in-one solutions such as DEIMS, GCE-toolbox
  - back-end databases such as LTER-metabase
