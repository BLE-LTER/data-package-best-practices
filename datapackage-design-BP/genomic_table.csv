"Attribute","Description"
"Sample_ID","Generally the locally used identifier for the sample, accession numbers may be used instead"
"Collection_date","Date of sample collection"
"Location_name","Locally used name of collection site"
"Latitude","Latitude of sampling area in decimal degrees"
"Longitude","Longitude of sampling area in decimal degrees"
"Genomics_repository","Name of genomics repository"
"Accession_number","Range of accession numbers or single accession number for a study.  Some studies have hundreds of accession numbers."
"Accession_link","Accession number based URL for the dataset in the genomics repository, e.g., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY741555](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY741555). <br> If providing a range of accession numbers, you may have to be creative, for example, by providing a search URL that will return the desired list, e.g., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset/?term=AY741555](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset/?term=AY741555). <br>Recommendation is to link to the widest level of granularity for which additional data useful to interpretation are ONLY archived on EDI. As an example, if an OTU table which is archived on EDI provides taxonomic identifications for many samples, it would be most useful for an end user if that table on EDI also contained the corresponding BioSample number from NCBI. However, if there are no derived products on EDI that exist on a per sample basis, then linking to the larger BioProject would be sufficient, because NCBI provides the child BioSample hierarchy under BioProject that will allow a user to discover all the data."
"seq_method","Sequencing method used; e.g., Sanger, pyrosequencing, ABI-solid. This attribute is used in MIxS templates, where it is called seq_meth."
"internal_control_seq ","Internal control sequences used in the dataset, e.g., *Thermus Thermophilus*. If no internal control is added then you could leave you could use *none* or indicate as such iethods section in EML if the same applies to all records in the dataset."
"env_biome","Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures, leaf types, plant spacing, and other factors like climate. Biome should be treated as the descriptor of the broad ecological context of a sample. Examples include: estuarine biome, marine coral reef biome, temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, or subtropical desert biome. EnvO (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: [www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO](www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO) by searching for *biome*. This attribute is used in MIxS templates."
"env_feature","Environmental feature level includes geographic environmental features. Compared to biome, feature is a descriptor of the more local environment. Examples include: harbor, cliff, or lake. EnvO (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: [www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO](www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO) by searching for *environmental feature*. This attribute is used in MIxS templates."
"env_material","The environmental material displaced by the sample, or material in which a sample was embedded, prior to the sampling event. Environmental material terms are generally mass nouns. Examples include: alluvial sediment or coastal sea water. EnvO (v 2013-06-14) terms can be found via the link: [www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO](www.environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO) by searching for *environmental material*. This attribute is used in MIxS templates."
"Taxon_description","If applicable, e.g., Genus species, or taxonomic group"
"Reference_publication","Title of publication providing in-depth context for data"
"Publication_DOI","Publication DOI"
