# Introduction

EML Best Practice recommendations have evolved over time. The most active contributors have been members of the LTER Information Managers Committee in multiple working groups and workshops. EML has been widely used for several years with multiple applications written against it, and the community has had the opportunity to observe the consequences of many content patterns. As much as possible, recommendations have been aligned with those experiences, as well as with the capability of data contributors.
