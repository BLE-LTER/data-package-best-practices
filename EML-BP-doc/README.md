# Purpose

Directory holds markdown for metadata-focused BPs. 

## Goals:
1. directory can be exported as a citable, versioned document, e.g. EML_metadata_best_practices_v4_yyyy.pdf
1. markdown files can be kept up to date by subcommittees, with a review plan for changes.



## Active:
top level holds active files. Generally, these are 
* markdown files, organized by metadata topics (generally aligned with EML elements)
* examples
* index.md - including link to most recent PDF distribution. 


## Inactive: 
* older versions of the doc can be found at [archive/](../archive) of this repository
