# pubDate

This element is found at this location (XPath):  
**/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate**

The year of public release of data online should be listed as the
<**pubDate**> element. Because this element may be used in
constructing citations, the **pubDate** also should reflect the
'recentness' of a package, with **pubDate** updated along with
significant revision or data additions (e.g., corrected data, or
additions to an ongoing time series). There is an argument for
**pubDate** referring to original date of release, but this is probably
only useful for static data packages, or if the only metadata changes
are to enhance discovery.
