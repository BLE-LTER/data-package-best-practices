# EML Best Practices {-}

This document contains current 'Best Practice' recommendations for EML content for metadata related to ecological and environmental data. It is intended to augment the EML schema documentation [@EML_2019] for a less-technical audience. This is one component of several resources available to EML preparers. These recommendations are directed towards the following goals:

- Provide guidance and clarification in the implementation of EML for datasets
- Minimize heterogeneity of EML documents to simplify development and re-use of software built to ingest it
- Maximize interoperability of EML documents to facilitate data synthesis
