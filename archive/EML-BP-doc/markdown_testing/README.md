Dir holds files related to conversion of EML BP v2 to markdown. goal was to learn if entire doc could become dynamic, 
maybe with sections editable by sub-WG. The original was converted with pandoc.

For now, this project is shelved. The doc still would have taking both significant editing and reformatting. We prioritized the 
editing (done in 2017) -- and which converted the content from LTER-based to EDI-based. 
We put off the reformatting (ie, for a different) platform for later.
