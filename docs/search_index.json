These recommendations are directed towards the following goals: Provide guidance and clarification in the use of Ecological Metadata Language (EML) Minimize heterogeneity of EML documents to simplify development and re-use of software built to ingest it Maximize interoperability of EML documents to facilitate data synthesis EML Metadata concepts These recommendations apply to most or all scientific domains. This section subsumes V3 of the static document “Best Practices for Dataset Metadata in Ecological Metadata Language (EML)” Best Practices for Dataset Metadata in Ecological Metadata Language (EML) Scientific domains This section contains recommendations for data from certain scientific domains. Many of these topics have extensive, related code bases, which some of these recommendations take into account (and link to). Examples: community survey data meteorology/hydrology data genomics and metagenomics [Recommendations for data from specific scientific domains{(scientific_domain/index.html)} Non-tabular data and other packaging challenges Certain data have special handling based on their acquisition method or platform. Some are raw data that should be preserved because they have uses beyond their original purpose. Many are not exclusive to a single scientific domain. Examples: offline data sometimes necessary if size prevents efficient delivery over HTTP key-value pair tables and the choice of long vs. wide model output drone-collected photo imagery quadrat photos for generating abundances series of still images from fixed cameras digital microscopy acoustics telemetry flow cytometry LINK TO BPs about non-tabular data types "],

To compile the PDF, you need XeLaTeX. Install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. site is served from the docs directory as gh-pages. 0.3 Steps (details TBD) edit markdown review in master branch, e.g. by BP committee or other build book(s) - output sent to docs add-commit-push (docs) 0.4 Other stuff you might need. also notes. some to be dropped how to pandoc how to handle citations with bib how to handle the left menu within books index page does not have to be a book how to drop numbering! this: ## Metadata concept {-} or even this: # {-} it might be a hack. if so, advise on better way. the search function (in header) only works once files are on a server. To preview drafts, use serve_book (if installed) or generate thru an Rproject. To create a bib database for R packages # automatically create a bib database for R packages knitr::write_bib(c( .packages(), &#39;bookdown&#39;, &#39;knitr&#39;, &#39;rmarkdown&#39; ), &#39;packages.bib&#39;) "]
