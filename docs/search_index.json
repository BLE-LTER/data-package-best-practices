These recommendations are directed towards the following goals: Provide guidance and clarification on the use of Ecological Metadata Language (EML) arrangement of tables or other data entities within different types of data packages Minimize heterogeneity of EML-described data packages to simplify development and re-use of software Maximize interoperability to facilitate data synthesis EML Metadata concepts These recommendations apply to most or all scientific domains. This section subsumes V3 of the static document “Best Practices for Dataset Metadata in Ecological Metadata Language (EML)” Best Practices for Dataset Metadata in Ecological Metadata Language (EML) Scientific domains This section contains recommendations for data from certain scientific domains. Many of these topics have extensive, related code bases, which some of these recommendations take into account (and link to). Examples: community survey data meteorology/hydrology data genomics and metagenomics Recommendations for data from specific scientific domains Non-tabular data and other packaging challenges Certain data have special handling based on their acquisition method or platform. Some are raw data that should be preserved because they have uses beyond their original purpose. Many are not exclusive to a single scientific domain. Examples: key-value pair tables and the choice of long vs. wide model output drone-collected photo imagery quadrat photos series of still images from fixed cameras digital microscopy video audio telemetry flow cytometry Recommendations for non-tabular and other packaging challenges Application-specific recommendations Recommendations for data intended for specific handling or intended for certain applications. In most cases these are mediated by EDI. TBD: decide if this goes here. if not, then where? Examples: offline data sometimes necessary if size prevents efficient delivery over HTTP) Specific features DataONE handles or indexes (or does not handle) Data that are to be replicated to another repository TBD: link (if it even goes here…) "],

Original pages can be found at https://github.com/EDIorg/data-package-best-practices, and the site is served from the docs directory as gh-pages. 0.2 Requirements 0.2.1 Bookdown The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) It is based on the sample from https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/bookdown-start.html 0.2.2 TinyTeX To compile the PDF, you need XeLaTeX. Install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. 0.3 Guidelines Chapters are defined by the the presence of first-level heading #. Each Rmd or md file contains one chapter the search function (in header) only works once files are on a server. it searches both text and code blocks. 0.4 Steps (details TBD) edit markdown (tbd: in a fork-PR? branch?) review, e.g. by BP committee or other, accept changes build book(s) - output sent to docs TBD: single script. add-commit-push (originals and docs) TBD: need guidelines for when a PDF is warranted (fixed doc was requested for EML section, maybe others) 0.5 Other stuff you might need. also notes. some to be dropped how to pandoc ? how to handle citations with bib how to handle the left menu within books index page does not have to be a book how to drop numbering! this: ## Metadata concept {-} or even this: # {-} it might be a hack. if so, advise on better way. what happens to files that have only second-level headings ## - they become subsections of the chapter loaded just ahead of them (with a top-level heading) the search function (in header) only works once files are on a server. To preview drafts, use serve_book (if installed) or generate thru an Rproject. To create a bib database for R packages # automatically create a bib database for R packages knitr::write_bib(c( .packages(), &#39;bookdown&#39;, &#39;knitr&#39;, &#39;rmarkdown&#39; ), &#39;packages.bib&#39;) "]
