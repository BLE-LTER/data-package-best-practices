## General info about this site.
- Git repository: https://github.com/EDIorg/data-package-best-practices
- iAll pages kept in  markdown
    - served as gh-pages (from the docs dir)
- contributions can be from many (via fork and pull request), moderated by a committee

### Section organization
#### Index section (e.g., this page) 
- based on a fork of http://bruth.github.io/jekyll-docs-template/


#### BP sections 
- generated with bookdown
    - a wrapper for pandoc (R package). 
- Goals:
    - pages can remain in development until they are explicitly posted, e.g., after moderation and build
    - PDF can be generated as needed for citable versions 
        - e.g., "Best Practices for EML metadata, V 4", anticipated in early 2020
    - for instructions on using pandoc for these pages: TBD

#### Instructions:
- Index section: tbd
- BP sections: tbd
