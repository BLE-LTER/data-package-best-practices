Best practices are procedures or guidelines that are accepted or prescribed as being correct or describing the most effective approach.

For data packages, this means:

- A set of guidelines that are usually not dependent on a particular implementation or software
- Justifiable - as in, what's best for a data type or metadata element
- Vetted *by a community*, rather than an example of a local practice 
    - to highlight or deseminate info about local projects consider a webinar, blog post, DataBits article, or that project's own Git repository documentation (e.g., as gh-pages). 
- Keep in mind that BPs can be influenced by both local practices and software choices, and that local practices can become community best practices after review.
