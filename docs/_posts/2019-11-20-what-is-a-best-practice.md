Best practices are procedures or guidelines that are accepted or prescribed as being correct or most effective.

For data packages, this means:

- A set of guidelinesthat not dependent on a particular implementation or software
- Justifiable - as in, what's best for a data type or metadata element
- Vetted by a community, rather than an example of a local practice 
    - to highlight local projects consider a webinar or databits article. 
- Keep in mind that BPs can be influenced by both local practices and software choices
