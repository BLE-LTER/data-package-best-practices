## What is a "Best Practice"?
- A set of guidelines, not dependent on a particular implementation or software
- Justifiable, as in, what's best for a data type or metadata element
- Decided on by a community. It's not just something that happened once, locally 
    - to highlight local projects consider a webinar or databits article. 
- Keep in mind that BPs can be influenced by both local practices and software choices
