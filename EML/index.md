===============
[EML Best Practices V3 Environmental Data Initiative. 2017 (linkable citation)](http://link/here.)

The above document contains recommended current views for best practices for EML content for our environmental data. It is intended to augment the EML schema documentation (normative documents) for a less technical audience. The current version (v3, 2017) is one component of several Best Practice documents available to EML constructors sites, and related documents and resources are listed at the bottom of this page. The recommendations are directed towards achieving the following specific goals:

- Provide guidance and clarification in the implementation of EML for     datasets
- Minimize heterogeneity of EML documents to simplify development and re-use of software built for EML datasets
- Maximize interoperability of EML documents to facilitate data synthesis

At time of publication (Autumn 2017), the proeuciton release of EML was EML.2.2.1. EML 2.3 is anticipated within the year.

EML Best Practice recommendations have evolved over time. Their most active contributors have come from the LTER Information Manager's Committee during multiple working groups (see [Timeline](#timeline). As much as possible, recommendations are aligned with the current capability of dataset contributors. EML has been widely used for several years with multiple applications written against it, and the community has had the opportunity to observe the consequences of many content patterns.


###<a name="generalrecommendations"> General Recommendations
=================================

Following are general best practices for handling EML dataset metadata:

*Metadata Distribution*: Do not publicly distribute EML documents containing elements with incorrect information as dataset metadata (i.e. as a workaround for missing metadata or to meet validation requirements). EML produced as draft, demonstration or for testing purposes should be clearly identified as such and not contributed to public metadata archives or clearinghouses.

*Data Package Identifiers*: Metadata and data set versioning are controlled by the contributor, and so identifiers are tied to local systems. Many repository systems that accepting EML-described data support principles of immutable metadata and data entity versioning.  EML has elements to contain package identifers, although these may be also be assigned externally. It is the responsibility of the submitters to understand the practices of their intended repository when using identifiers.

*High-priority Elements*: 
* To support locating datasets by time, geographic location, and taxonomically, metadata should provide as much information as possible, in the three &lt;**coverage**&gt; elements of &lt;**temporalCoverage**&gt; (when), &lt;**taxonomicCoverage**&gt; (what), and &lt;** geographicCoverage**&gt; (where) for the dataset.
* For a potential user to evaluate the relevance and usability of the data package for their research study or synthesis projects, metadata should include detailed descriptions in the &lt;**project**&gt;, &lt;**methods**&gt;, &lt;**protocols**&gt;, and &lt;**intellectualRights**&gt; elements.
